# Angry Purple Tiger
Angry Purple Tiger generates animal-based hash digests meant to be memorable
and human-readable. Angry Purple Tiger is apt for anthropomorphizing project
names, crypto addresses, UUIDs, or any complex string of characters that
needs to be displayed in a user interface.

## Example

```js
import animalHash from 'angry-purple-tiger';

const digest = animalHash('my ugly input string');
console.log(digest);
//=> rapid grey rattlesnake
```
